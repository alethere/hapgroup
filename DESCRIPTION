Title: Haplotype allele clustering
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Alejandro Therese Navarro
Maintainer: Alejandro Therese Navarro <alejandro.th.na@gmail.com>
Description: This package can be used to cluster alleles of phased data using
  a graph-based clustering approach. It simplifies several analyses of allele diversity,
  allele comparison, allele similarity, and frequency. 
    The main utility within this package is an R6 class `hapBlock` which automates
  allele comparison and grouping and can be easily used to perform haplotype analysis
  at a large scale. Importantly, this analysis depends on already-phased SNP data, which
  can be achieved through tools like BEAGLE, SHAPEIT, WhatsHap, etc.
